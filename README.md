2. Choose the window where your ipad is being shared. In my case, I'm choosing the Quick time window as my ipad mini 4 doesn't have side car available. But you can pick whatever you're using to present your ipad screen at you computer.

I'm using pre-build whitboard for sake of better communication and engagement. You can find my Tanzu drwainings here.

And no, you cannot use your markers for this whiteboard. That is merely figurative! :)
