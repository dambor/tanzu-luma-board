## Create your Luma board

1. Create a window capture

![scene](https://github.com/dambor/tanzu-luma-board/blob/master/pictures/window-capture.png?raw=true)

2. Choose the window where your ipad is being shared. In my case, I'm choosing the Quick time window as my ipad mini 4 doesn't have side car available. But you can pick whatever you're using to present your ipad screen at you computer.

I'm using pre-build whitboard for sake of better communication and engagement. You can find my Tanzu drawings [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kseF458=/).

And no, you cannot use your real markers on this whiteboard. That is merely figurative! :) 

Voil√°!! Happy Tanzu Luma Boarding!!
